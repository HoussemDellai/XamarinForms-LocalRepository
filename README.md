# XamarinForms-LocalRepository
Xamarin.Forms project that shows an easy solution to store data using files instead of dealing with complicated Database. 

How it works?
To save an object, it serializes it into JSON text/string and stores it into a file.
To get the saved object, it retrieves the previously saved text/string, deserializes it into the object type.

This project uses Json.net to perform serialization and deserialization.

Here is a screenshot for the application running on Windows Phone:
